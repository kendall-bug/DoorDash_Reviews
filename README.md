# DoorDash User Experience

The 1,000 Most Recent DoorDash reviews are extracted from the Google Play Store to monitor the customer experience of Android users who have downloaded the DoorDash app. Important information for each review is captured, such as the day it was written, the user's overall star rating, and which version of the app the customer has installed.

Hugging Face's Emotion English DistilRoBERTa-base model has been chosen to classify each review into a pre-determined emotion: Joy, Sadness, Anger, Surprise, Neutral, or Fear. Learn more about the model here, or try it out for yourself!
